A note about arrow functions -> They are not standalone functions, here we assign the value of a function to a variable.
We can use arrow functions in high orders functions as a parameter passing or we use it as callbacks
A callback is simply a function that is passed in another function as an argument or a parameter.

syntax:
const func = (arg1, arg2..) =>{ function definition }

eg 
const sum = (a,b) =>{
    console.log(a,b);
}
